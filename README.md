## Introduction & Background

Understanding what drives sales, profits, and customer behavior is critical to any product-based business. This project dives into the analysis of a product sales data to uncover key performance drivers, spot underperforming products, and reveal patterns in profitability and customer demand.
The dataset includes detailed information on product names, transaction dates, units sold, pricing, and more. The goal was to transform this raw dataset into a powerful business tool  enabling real-time insights and decision-making through interactive dashboards and KPIs.
The dashboard enables decision-makers to monitor key metrics, uncover underperforming products, and spot opportunities for product development, marketing, and pricing improvements.


Strategic Questions from the Analysis
- What products generate the most revenue and profit?
- Which items are overperforming or underperforming?
- Are there seasonal trends in customer purchases?
- How do profit margins vary across different product categories?
- What insights can drive smarter inventory, pricing, or marketing decisions?

**Additional Data Preparation Notes**
- Part of the initial data cleaning (e.g., removing blanks, correcting column names) was performed using *Microsoft Excel*.
- Created additional columns in both *Excel* and *Power BI*, including extracting months and years from date fields.

## üîç Key Insights & Business Recommendations

### üí∞ 1. Strong Profitability Across Products

‚úÖ *Recommendation*: Maintain current pricing and cost strategy, but regularly monitor input costs to ensure profitability is sustained. Consider reinvesting surplus margin into marketing or product development.

###  2. Chocolate Chip Dominates Sales & Profit
Chocolate Chip is the most profitable and top-selling product, accounting for over *$1.01M in profit (37.5%)*, with the highest number of units sold and revenue earned.

‚úÖ *Recommendation*: Treat this as your flagship product. Invest in product innovation (e.g., flavors, packaging), feature it in promotions, and create deals or loyalty bundles that focus on it so as to drive more value.

  ### ‚ö† 3. Sugar  ‚Äì High Sales Volume, Low Profit Return
Sugar Cookie sells a lot (~170K units), but contributes relatively little to total profit. This indicates a *low profit margin per unit*, suggesting possible underpricing or high production costs.

‚úÖ *Recommendation*: Take note of the product‚Äôs pricing strategy and cost structure. Consider raising the price slightly, improving the product's packaging , or reducing overhead (operational costs) without compromising quality.

###  4. Fortune Cookie & Snickerdoodle Are Underperforming
These products show minimal contribution to revenue and profit. They may be poorly positioned, under-marketed, or not appealing to the target audience.

‚úÖ *Recommendation*: Run a targeted A/B test (Product Test) campaign to validate interest. If no performance improvement is seen, consider phasing them out to reduce inventory clutter and focus on higher-performing SKUs.


### üìÖ 5. Seasonal Demand Peaks in October & December
Revenue is highest in *Q4 (October and December)*,this is likely due to seasonal events and increased gifting behavior.

‚úÖ *Recommendation: Plan inventory, marketing, and supply chain around these seasonal peaks. Start promotions in **September* and launch bundled or limited-edition holiday packs to maximize profit.

‚úÖ *Recommendation*: Analyze what drove this growth (new channels, product launches, seasonal campaigns) and replicate or scale those initiatives across other products or markets.

### üì¶ 7. Bulk Transaction Behavior Indicates B2B Sales
1.12 million units were sold across just 700 transactions ‚Äî that‚Äôs an average of *~1,600 units per transaction*, pointing strongly toward B2B (business-to-business) customers.

‚úÖ  Recommendation: Launch a *B2B loyalty program* or *wholesale-tier pricing*. Provide tailored onboarding and service levels for repeat bulk buyers to improve retention and transaction volume.

### üéØ 8. Profit Distribution Is Uneven
Some products yield high margins, while others significantly lower the average. This uneven spread shows which items are driving growth ‚Äî and which ones are liabilities.

### üß© 9. Limited Product Diversification
The majority of revenue and profit is driven by just 2‚Äì3 products. This leaves the business vulnerable to changes in customer preference or supply disruptions related to those items.

‚úÖ **Recommendation**: Experiment with bundling mid-performing products with best-sellers (bulk selling), and use insights to explore new variants that match the profile and taste of top selling products.
